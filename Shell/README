/************************
 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. 

 * You are required to provide a good README document including the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can use pseudocode to describe your
 * implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your C code. Specifically, you should explain details corresponding 
 * to (1) multiple pipelines (2) job control (3) logging (3) .c commands 
 * compilation and execution. We expect the design and implementation details to 
 * be at most 1-2 pages.  A plain textfile is encouraged. However, a pdf is acceptable. 
 * No other forms are permitted.

 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.
